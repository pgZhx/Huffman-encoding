Our goal is to offer Canadian users a smaller and less intimidating support group, as well as promote the adoption of Ubuntu at home in Canada. 

== Reasons to Become a Member ==
 * Ubuntu-CA is a local effort for Canadians, and by Canadians, and as such it will offer a smaller and less intimidating support group for members. 
 * We will have a wide range of support option for new users. Including Forums, IRC, Mailing lists, Wiki,  and perhaps others yet to come.
 * We plan to hook into all of the Canadian LUGS(Linux User Groups) from coast to coast so the CanadianTeam will be a great way for you to see just how large the Canadian Linux community is, and then enable you to join it.
 * We plan to also host links to any Canadian businesses that are Linux friendly.
 * We need '''your''' help, each member has the potential to add to this community in a positive way. Through new and interesting ideas as well as technical know-how and just general positive attitudes. Together we can make a difference.

== Why Does Ubuntu Canada exist? ==

Q: What is the point of a Local group for Canada? English and French are already very well supported.

A: This is actually a good thing, because while many teams need to struggle with translation issues we do not. Instead, we can focus our efforts on the next logical step which is promotion and community building on a local scale.

Q: Quel est le but d'un groupe local pour le Canada? L'anglais et le français sont déja très bien supportés.

A: À vrai dire, c'est une bonne chose, parce que plusieurs équipes doivent se battre avec des problèmes de traduction que nous n'avons pas. À la place, nous pouvons concentrer nos efforts sur la prochaine étape logique, laquelle est la promotion et la construction d'une communauté à l'échelle locale.

Q: Canada's too big for just one group. Shouldn't we focus on the city or town level?

A: Yes, your primary focus should be building the Ubuntu community where you live.  But it's easier for people to join something than start something.  Keeping the national LoCo as a meeting place for people in the cities and towns to share ideas and gain support makes it easier for people to start something in their town.  

== Translation Work ==
If you would like to make en_CA translations, a modified version of en_GB.pl is available at http://www.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~ja2morri/programs/en_GB.pl.  

More details can be found at http://live.gnome.org/BritishEnglish.
